## What is this book about?
With Plotly's Dash framework, it is now easier than ever for Python programmers to develop complete data apps and interactive dashboards. Dash apps can be used by a non-technical audience, and this will make data analysis accessible to a much wider group of people. This book will help you to explore the functionalities of Dash for visualizing data in different ways and getting the most out of it.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Find out how to run a fully interactive and easy-to-use app
* Convert your charts to various formats including images and HTML files
* Use Plotly Express and the grammar of graphics for easily mapping data to various visual attributes
* Create different chart types, such as bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, maps, and more
* Expand your app by creating dynamic pages that generate content based on URLs

Learn how to build a fully customized dashboard using a real-life dataset.

In this book, we also go through **The World Bank**'s **Poverty and Equity Database** to build
an interactive dashboard, that allows users to interactivley create the chart
they want and make the comparisons they want.

By the end of the book, you will have built and deployed this
[Plotly Dash app](https://povertydata.org) online, which is available for you to test and play with.

Although every chapter builds on previous chapters, each new functionality is
first built as a mini independent app, and works on its own. These can be found
in the JupyterLab notebooks in each of the respective chapters.

You also get a $100 hosting credit from Linode (to be consumed within 60 days of creating your account), so you can test it on an actual server and share it with the world.

Watch here the evolution of the [Dash app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIWU6IwWAxw) that we build, going through chapters one by one.
